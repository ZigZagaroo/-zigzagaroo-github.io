Personal porfolio site for a web design course resubmission

A frankenstein mish mash of differing attempts of trying lines of code I'm inexperienced with and tackling with javascript, of which I am extremely unfamiliar with

It has the odd visual error involving some awkwardly placed text and out of place position with the light box displays, but overall I am satisfied with having it completed in as close
to my original vision as I could.
